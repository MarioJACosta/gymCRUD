Simple CRUD app to test SLIM framework

I've assumed that one user can only have one plan.

One plan can have many workouts.

One workout can have many exercises.

When adding new records there is no validation of the data neither if the record is repeated.

When editing Plans, the new Workouts are just added. The same happens for Workouts with Exercises. 

There isn't any kind of validation for repeated records.
